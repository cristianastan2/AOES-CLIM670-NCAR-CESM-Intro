A couple of weeks ago you learned about the various Earth system models being used by the research and operational communities. Today we will learn about the NCAR/Community Earth System Model. 

### NCAR/Community Earth System Model (CESM)
* Designed for community use -- easy to use for research 
* Large community of people working with CESM â€“ Organized in working groups that are open to all (http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/)
* Easy to get help, lots of documentation: (http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/) 
* CESM has different (and more) Earth system components 
* Many components can be combined together in endless combinations 
* Easy to change configuration (e.g. output frequency, grid). 
* Primary mission is climate oriented 
* Many existing climate simulations and now hindcasts (CMIP, large ensemble, decadal prediction, S2S prediction) 
* More recently starting to be used for prediction/predictability purposes (e.g. new Earth System Prediction Working Group). 
* Lots of people in AOES work with this model.
